Once installed, it provides three modes to modify usernames in Twitch chat:

2. **Icon Mode**: Appends a specific crew icon next to the username based on its first letter. Usernames starting with letters A-M get the 'A Crew' icon, while the rest, including those starting with numbers or symbols, get the 'Z Crew' icon.
3. **Name Change Mode**: Similar to the previous version, usernames starting with letters A-M are displayed as 'A Crew', and all others as 'Z Crew'.
